==========

Develop ACCU website, version 3

ACCU's current website was launched in 2006. It looks dated and is hard to administer and change compared to current content management systems.

We like to have a website that
* clearly presents what ACCU is and what it offers,
* is pleasant to visit and easy to use with different devices,
* is inviting to use for editors.

Probably the most daunting task is to make the membership system work on a new website.

This GitHub project with its [wiki](https://github.com/accu-org/website-v3/wiki) is meant to hold plans, documentation and code related to the development of ACCU website, version 3.
